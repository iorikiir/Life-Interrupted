<p>Expeditionary Force, which was in fact really the 44th Battery, and at once commenced its organization</p>.

<p>The Artillery from Australia for the Expeditionary Force was made up of 1st 2nd and 3rd Brigade, Batteries numbered from 1 to 9, with their Ammunition Columns and also the Divisional Ammunition Column.
The 1st Brigade was Commanded by Major Christian R.A.F.A., and was raised in N. S. Wales, the 2nd Brigade, raised in Victoria, was Commanded by Lieut. Col Johnstone and the 3rd Brigade was Composite, and consisted of 7th Battery drawn from Queensland, 8th Battery from W. Australia. 9th Battery from Tasmania, and details of Ammunition Column from all states. This Brigade therefore has representatives in its ranks from every state of the Commonwealth, and is therefore essentially Australian.</p>

<p>On August 26th I was given command of the 3rd Brigade and set to work to get it organized as quickly as possible. Lt Jopp RAFA was appointed Adjutant and Lieut Clowes R.M.C. appointed Orderly Officer. I was promoted to rank of Lieut Colonel on September 17th 1914.</p>

<p>I visited Queensland in Company with Col Hobbs, Divisional Commander, and Major Anderson, Brigade Major, spending a couple of days in Brisbane. I then returned to Sydney where I remained some days, thence journeyed to Melbourne and Tasmania, putting in some days in Brighton Camp near Hobart with the 9th Battery. I then returned to Sydney, via Melbourne, stayed there some days attending to arrangements for men and horses embarking from Sydney for Tasmania. I also at this time inspected the Troop Ship "Rangatira" (A.22) lying at Pyrmont wharf and was delighted with the general Arrangements. The boat was fitted out by the Garden Island Authorities. I sent my Orderly & Horse to Brisbane by this Transport and some days afterwards myself left by rail for Brisbane. I found it terribly hard saying "Goodbye" to my wife and second son at Sydney railway station, and never again hope to have a similar experience.</p>

<p>I arrived at Brisbane on the evening of September 24th and immediately reported to the District Commandant who gave me certain instructions and information. On the morning of the 25th in Company with the District Commandant I went by Launch to Pinkenbar, and boarded the Transport which had been loaded with horses the night before and was ready to leave at noon.<br />
I have shut down my practice and closed my doors. My connection must look after itself. Henceforward my records will be in Diary form.
