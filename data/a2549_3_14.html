<p>we used to have good times at Kenso for most of the chaps had friends & relations, & they used to bring big hamper's of all sorts of good things, & of course the boys would share them round.

Not so very long before we left Kensington Len came down from Scone to see me, & while there he kidded me to have my photo taken in my equipment, I have regretted ever since, that those photos ever reached home, if I could lay my hands on them, I don't think they would live long, a chap looks a perfect fool in them
