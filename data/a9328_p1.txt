31.12.1917

Good bye to 1917. Was awakened at 2.30 a.m. to the sound of close shelling & quickly detected a faint sweetest scent like pineapple when immediately followed a loud knock outside & Owen saying "Sister Donnell Theyre sending over gas shells – Have your gas respirator ready" I jumped up tout-de-suite as did most of us - & got dressed shivered & shook & coughed and I seemed as if I never should manipulate that respirator – The sister next door called out – to see if I had croaked.
10 p.m. Will this restless life never end. As I write the shelling is going on again - heavier too. I am not undressing – It's a terrible life this. Ma first 1917
