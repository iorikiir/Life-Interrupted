<p>Diary
Friday 25th September, 1914

<p>This morning I have seen the District Paymaster and handed to him my pay allotment for my wife. I also interviewed the O.C. Army Service Corps and arranged for sand to be placed on board transport for a sand bath for horses. Horses were embarked by men of units, commencing at 5 P.M. 24th instant; finishing at 12 midnight Sept 24th/25th. One horse caused a great deal of trouble, and eventually backed over the wharf into the river. It was subsequently rescued.

<p>The District Commandant invited me to proceed from Brisbane to Pinkenbar in the Naval launch. On arrival at the troop ship I took over custody of cash for use of men on board and had some placed in Captain’s Safe. The Commandant issued to me a message of farewell from His Excellency Sir Arthur Morgan, Governor of Queensland, to the troops of all Transports from Queensland, and as the "Rangatira" was the last to leave I was asked to transmit the message by wireless to other ships. The Commandant also personally addressed the troops. He informed me Mr Jopp’s work as Adjutant had been most unsatisfactory.
The troopship left wharf at Pinkenbar at 12.50 PM amid the tooting of whistles and sirens, and the "good byes" of the Soldiers friends and relatives.

<p>The Veterinary Officer reported a sick horse which he had refused to accept, but which was ultimately ordered to be taken (by the Veterinary Board). This horse had been ill for a week prior to embarkation.

<p>Weather beautifully fine and so far no symptoms of sea sickness.

<p>Saturday 26th September

<p>A very beautiful morning. The rugged coast in the rising sun looks particularly fine. With Col Sutton, the Senior medical Officer on Board I made a thorough inspection of the ship at 10 AM. Parades during the day of gunners at gun drill and fuze setting, rifle exercises, etc. Cleaning up ship generally. Lecture at night to all officers on general Conduct and duties on Board Troopship. Veterinary Officer reported sick horse to be very bad. I had him moved to the deck and specially fed. The Senior Medical Officer reported two cases of venereal disease. Cases were at once isolated.
I interviewed the Adjutant re very unsatisfactory report of his work furnished to me by District Commandant of Queensland, supported by a similar report from the A.A.G. I warned him his promotion to rank of Captain and the keeping of his position at all would depend on the way his duties in the future are carried out. I have given personal instruction to all trumpeters and buglers.
