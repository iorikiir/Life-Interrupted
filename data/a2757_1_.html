[DÉCEMBRE 1916]<br />
[Vendredi 29]<br />
My motto’s while in the army is as follows<br />
Do as you are told<br />
Be obliging always<br />
Smile at trouble<br />
Never say die<br />
Think for yourself but never speak them but just wander around and say nothing<br />
Dont argue for it “aint worth while
